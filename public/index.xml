      <description>Introduction I decided to work with halloween candy data for this project since it seemed fun, it’s about what kind of candy people would like to recieve during halloween. This data set has 13 variables, most of which are categorical variables that are already sorted with 0’s and 1’s to represent if they do or don’t have the variable listed. They surveyed 85 types of candy, thus there are 85 observations.</description>

      <description>Introduction I chose my data sets based on two viruses that have spread on a world scale, one of these viruses being the corona virus since it’s what’s on most peoples mind at the moment. The other virus that I chose was ebola which about 5 years ago brought out similar concers that are being evoked by carona. I wanted to compare these two viruses and see how they are infecting people and spreading worldwide!</description>
